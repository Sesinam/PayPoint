# PayPoint
PayPoint is a point of sale (POS) web application for agricultural products. I came up with this project, as a requisite for my fellowship with Developers in Vogue to learn web development. I seek to solve the issue of farm product accessibilty, PayPoint allows users to buy farm produce at the convenience of their homes, users can also purchase seeds or any farm produce they want, they can either pick it up or have it delivered to them. PayPoint integrates JavaScript, HTML and CSS to run fully. PayPoint is currently a front end version, looking to working on the back end and incorporating it as well. Back end will employ node.js, using the express framework.
